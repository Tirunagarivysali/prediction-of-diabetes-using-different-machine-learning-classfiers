# prediction-of-diabetes-using-different-machine-learning-classfiers
code is completely written in python using jupyter notebook software.
six different machine learning classification algorithms i.e, Decision tree ,naive bayes ,artificial neural network ,support vector machine, Logistic Regression and Random Forest classifier are used in this.Perfomance and accuracies of all six algorithms were compared.
Random forest with 81.81 % accuracy was shown better result.
PPT regarding this was also uploaded here.
For this,PIMA indian diabetes dataset of 768 female patients(containing 8 different attributes) data was used.
•	The accuracy of each algorithm are :
•	Decision tree - 71.43% 
•	Naive bayes  - 73.59%
•	Logistic Regression - 70.56%
•	Support Vector Machine - 73.59% 
•	Artificial Neural Network - 70.13%
•	Random Forest Classifier - 81.81%
